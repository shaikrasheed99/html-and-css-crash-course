# CSS Ids

Id is the one of the selectors in CSS. 

It will select the element with a id name.

Hash (#) is used to select specific element with id name. `#id-name`

`NOTE:` HTML elements can have only one Id.

* We can select the element with specific id name. 

```css
div#id-name {
    color: red;
}
```

* We can select the id inside a specific element with the help of single space between element and the id name. 

```css
div #id-name {
    color: white;
}
```

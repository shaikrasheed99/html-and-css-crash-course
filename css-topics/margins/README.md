# CSS Margins

CSS Margins are used to create outside space around the elements. 

We can specify margin for each side with the help of below properties. 
* `margin-top`
* `margin-right`
* `margin-bottom`
* `margin-left`

We have multiple shorthands to define margins. 

1. `margin` can have four values.
    ```css
        margin: 1px 2px 3px 4px
    ```
        * `top` has 1px margin
        * `right` has 2px margin
        * `bottom` has 3px margin
        * `left has` 4px margin

2. `margin` can have three values.
    ```css
        margin: 1px 2px 3px
    ```
        * `top` has 1px margin
        * `right` & `left` has 2px margin
        * `bottom` has 3px margin

3. `margin` can have two values. 
    ```css
        margin: 1px 2px
    ```
        * `top` & `bottom` has 1px margin
        * `right` & `left` has 2px margin

4. `margin` can have only one value. 
    ```css
        margin: 1px
    ```
        * `top` & `bottom` & `right` & `left` has 1px margin

`auto` value of margin can be used to center elements.
